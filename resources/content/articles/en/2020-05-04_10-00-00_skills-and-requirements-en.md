## IELE Skill Set

As an experienced blockchain developer, you are familiar with writing smart contracts in Solidity and have an understanding of the build tool [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview). You should be familiar with an integrated development environment such as Remix and comfortable with wallets in the command line, like Mallet. Familiarity with higher-level languages such as Java and JavaScript is desirable and knowledge of the JSON remote procedure call (RPC) protocol is recommended.

For testing purposes, you will need a suite of well-defined smart contracts to use on the IELE testnet. Please note there is no registration required to use the testnet.

In case you need a refresher on using smart contracts in general, go through the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts). This is sufficient for you to be able to use the IELE testnet.
