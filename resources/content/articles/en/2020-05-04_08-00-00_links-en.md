### Marlowe papers

Marlowe was introduced in [this paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/marlowefinancial-contracts-on-blockchain/), which explains the design and rationale for Marlowe. This paper describes an earlier version of Marlowe, which differs significantly from the current version.

A [recent paper](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/marloweimplementing-and-analysing-financial-contracts-on-blockchain/) presents details about how Marlowe is implemented on the Cardano blockchain, and how Marlowe contracts are analysed.
