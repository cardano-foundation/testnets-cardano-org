## Support and help

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano and the testnet. We have an active Telegram channel and a dedicated [support page](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/900000102203-Shelley-Testnet) to help you with your issues and questions. 

TELEGRAM CHANNEL: CARDANO DEVELOPERS

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just join the [@CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup channel](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).

HOW TO GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT
To contact IOG Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). You can also click the 'Support' button at the bottom right of your screen. The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
