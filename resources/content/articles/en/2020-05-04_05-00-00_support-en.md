## Support and help

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano and the testnet. We have an active Telegram channel and a dedicated [support page](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/900000102203-Shelley-Testnet) to help you with your issues and questions. 

We are also creating documentation with the support of our pioneers, a small group of stake pool operators. As that documentation is completed, we will add it to the sections on this website. Please check back regularly, or you can access draft documentation [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/testnets-cardano-org).

TELEGRAM CHANNEL: CARDANO DEVELOPERS

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just join the [@CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup channel](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).

HOW TO GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT
To contact IOHK Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). You can also click the Support button at the bottom right of your screen. The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
