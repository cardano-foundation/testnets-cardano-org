## Support and help

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano and the testnet. During the initial ‘Friends and Family’ testnet phase we have a dedicated Telegram channel for our pioneer pools, where we are collaborating closely to set things up and get ready for the public testnet when the whole community will be able to join.

We are currently creating documentation with the support of our pioneers, a small group of stake pool operators. As that documentation is completed, we shall add it to the sections on this website. So, please check back regularly, or you can access draft documentation [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/testnets-cardano-org).

TELEGRAM CHANNEL: CARDANO DEVELOPERS

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just join the [@CardanoDevelopersOfficial](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial) channel.
