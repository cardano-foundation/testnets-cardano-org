## Faucet

### What is the Faucet?

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ada to users of the testnet. While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ada on the mainnet.
                
#### To request tokens using the faucet:

1. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
1. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any additional funds you may have been allocated
1. Click **Request funds**.
1. Funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes

*We have applied a daily faucet limit of 1000 test ada a day for each testnet user to ensure everyone has access to funds.*

Default funds are in tAda (test Ada).

```diff
- The faucet currently seems to having technical issues. Please bear with us while we get this sorted
