## The testnet faucet

Since the Shelley Haskell testnet is an independent network, separate from the Cardano mainnet, it requires its own tokens.

The faucet is a web-based service that provides free tokens to users of the testnet who are running a stake pool or other node. The tokens enable users to experiment with Cardano features without spending ada cryptocurrency on the mainnet.

You will need some initial funds to start testing stake pools and delegating stake on the testnet network. The faucet component will provide you with the tokens required to get started.

### Accessing the testnet faucet
You can access the testnet faucet using the form below, where you must enter a wallet address to receive the testnet funds.

Follow these instructions to get testnet tokens from the faucet:
1. Enter the address you want tokens sent to in the field below.
1. Click 'Request'.
1. Wait for funds to be accessible. This usually takes 5-10 minutes.

When you have finished using your testnet tokens, please return them to the faucet so that other members of the community can use them. Tokens should be returned to this address: **ca1s44h5hytev8d9wty220ckglvj7ewm3yetyug8a29pu2lj5dff28sy2yf8yj**
