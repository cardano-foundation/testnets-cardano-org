## About Vasil testnet

Cardano’s Vasil upgrade is now available on the Cardano public testnet.

Vasil will enforce the next major upgrade to the Cardano protocol. It will be enacted in June 2022 using [Cardano’s HFC approach](https://docs.cardano.org/core-concepts/about-hard-forks). It is named after a much loved and respected Cardano community member, Vasil St Dabov.

The goal for the Vasil hard fork is to improve on-chain performance. Specifically, it will enhance [the handling of on-chain (Plutus) scripts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/04/13/boosting-cardano-s-throughput-with-script-referencing/), reducing user costs and allowing [greater script throughput,](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/03/21/increasing-the-transaction-throughput-of-cardano/) as well as making it easier for developers to produce new scripts. Vasil changes form the first stages of a series of planned improvements that will be rolled out over time.

More specifically, the release introduces:

-   New Plutus primitives, a tuned Plutus interpreter, and a new Plutus cost model
-   Plutus reference inputs
-   Plutus inline datums
-   Plutus reference scripts
-   Diffusion pipelining

### Getting started

To maximize the value of this testnet, all you have to do is get involved. Running a node, delegating stake, or setting up and maintaining a stake pool - all of these activities will test the network and add to the quality of the final Vasil implementation. 

To geat started, make sure you:
