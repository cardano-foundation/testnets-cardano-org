## Overview

The Cardano testnet gives stake pool operators and smart contract developers the opportunity to actively test core Cardano functionality prior to deploying on mainnet. This includes stake pool operation, native tokens, metadata, smart contract testing, and DeFi cost estimation. 

The Cardano testnet has now been upgraded to Vasil functionality. Find out more about the Vasil upgrade and features in the following sections.
