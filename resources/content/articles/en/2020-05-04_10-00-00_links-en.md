* [Getting Started with Mallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp4Z0RbjSa8) How to install the mallet command-line tool, and how to use it to compile, deploy and test smart contracts written in Solidity on the IELE-Testnet.
* [Smart Contracts in IELE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4Zrvu3bVE) How to compile a simple Solidity contract to IELE, optimize the resulting IELE by hand and then deploy and test the contract, all using the Mallet command-line tool.

### Blog posts
