A newly-created pool does not have any data to determine its apparent performance. This data will be needed to calculate the pool's desirability and non-myopic rewards. To include a new pool in the ranked display of pools, a wallet needs to pick a default value for the apparent performance.

Pool ranking

A pool's rank is determined by ordering pools in a decreasing order of desirability. The most desirable pool will be ranked #1, the second most desirable will be ranked #2, and so on. In this context, “desirability” is a measure of potential rewards that a pool will pay to delegators.

From a technical standpoint, three factors determine a pool's desirability: Pledge (higher pledges increase desirability), cost (the lower, the better), and performance, where the relative influence of pledge versus cost is determined by the "a0" parameter. 

The values costs c and margin m define the desirability of a pool with pledged owner stakes. These values represent how “desirable” or “attractive” the pool is to potential members.

But there is also a 'social' aspect to the perception of desirability for a particular pool or set of pools. In other words, word of mouth, promotion, and other social factors will play a role in determining a pool's desirability.
